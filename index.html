      <h2>A brief Biography of Reverend Kenneth E. Hagin </h2>

      <article id="Early-Life">
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Kenneth E. Hagin was born August 20, 1917 in McKinney, Texas, the son of Lillie Viola Drake Hagin and Jess Hagin. According to Hagin's testimony, he was born with a deformed heart and what was believed to be an incurable blood disease. He
          was not expected to live and at age 15 became paralyzed and bedridden. In April 1933 he converted to Christianity. During a dramatic conversion experience, he reported dying, due to the deformed heart, three times in 10 minutes, each time
          seeing the horrors of hell and then returning to life. He remained paralyzed after his conversion.

          On August 8, 1934, he was raised from his deathbed by a revelation of "faith in God's Word" after reading Mark 11:23-24. He was also healed of his paralysis and never struggled with walking. His dramatic healing is detailed in Roberts
          Liardon's book: God's Generals.</p>
